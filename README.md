## Context
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the film industry in 2020. Many theaters and festivals have to be closed and postponed. Additionally, film releases have been rescheduled and delayed infinitely. Nevertheless, this has given streaming services a lot of opportunities to shine. I, as a software developer, notices this potentials and wants to follow the trend by making a website to stream movies, series, etc. Users can get updates about upcoming trailers, news, etc. After watching movies, they can give a like and review. The website is named as CineFlex, which is the combination of the word “Cine” and “Flex”. “Cine” is a short form of “Cinema” and “Flex” is from “flexible”. From the brand name, I want to give the users a flexible, comfortable experience when using our web service, just l ike they are going to the cinema to watch it.

## Admin pages
Admins can perform all CRUD operations on the website. This includes adding, editing, removing, getting films, news and new admin. These resources will be saved to the database for permanent storage. A third-party API called TMDB (The Movie Database) is also integrated to help admins get the details of any movie in the industry. This helps provide the profundity for movie resources.

## User pages
There are two types of normal users, guest and registered users. As a guest, you can watch movies and read news. However, you have to register an acccount if you want some other advanced features, such as liking, commenting and rating movies. Movies that user likes will be saved to their account so they can access them more easily in their profile page.

## Responsiveness
The website is totally responsive on different viewport sizes or devices. Using TailwindCSS as a CSS library, the development process has been optimized. On the other hand, the library also helps keep the page consistent and well-aligned.

## Conclusion
Having completed this website, I learnt tons of useful things about full-stack web development. Being responsible for implementing the RESTful backend service and also the Single Page Application frontend, I fully understand how they communicates with each other, how to build a database schema with complex connected tables and lastly, how enjoyful it is to make a website that can be deployed and used by many people.
