## Context

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on the film industry in 2020. Many theaters and festivals have to be closed and postponed. Additionally, film releases have been rescheduled and delayed infinitely. Nevertheless, this has given streaming services a lot of opportunities to shine. I, as a software developer, notices this potentials and wants to follow the trend by making a website to stream movies, series, etc. Users can get updates about upcoming trailers, news, etc. After watching movies, they can give a like and review. The website is named as CineFlex, which is the combination of the word “Cine” and “Flex”. “Cine” is a short form of “Cinema” and “Flex” is from “flexible”. From the brand name, I want to give the users a flexible, comfortable experience when using our web service, just l ike they are going to the cinema to watch it.

## Conclusion
Having completed this website, I learnt tons of useful things about full-stack web development. Being responsible for implementing the RESTful backend service and also the Single Page Application frontend, I fully understand how they communicates with each other, how to build a database schema with complex connected tables and lastly, how enjoyful it is to make a website that can be deployed and used by many people.
